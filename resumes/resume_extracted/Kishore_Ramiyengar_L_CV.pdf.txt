Project Description 

Auto-enrolment will mean workers being automatically enrolled into their employer's qualifying pension 

scheme without any active decision on their part. At present, many workers fail to take up valuable 

pension benefits because they do not make an application to join their employer's scheme. Auto-

enrolment is meant to overcome this. 

From 1 October 2012 (subject to the employer's own introduction date), all eligible workers will have to 

be auto-enrolled into a qualifying pension scheme.  Employers can choose the qualifying scheme they 

use, which could include NEST (the National Employment Savings Trust).  Each qualifying scheme must 

meet minimum standards in respect of the benefits it provides or the amount of contributions paid to it.  

The scheme must also provide auto-enrolment for all eligible workers and for all new workers when they 

become eligible.
