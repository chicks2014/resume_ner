Work Experience

·  Vodafone Shared Services 
DATA Scientist (May 2016 to till date)

 Project 1: 	   Prediction of inbound calls recording 
Technology used: Kernel SVM
Database: 	   SQL 
Summary:             All the calls received by the agents are being recorded
	                 and with the help of Kernel SVM we able to predict the 
		                when there is issue with the recording servers.


 Project 2: 	   Clustering of alarms generated by various Networking devices 
Technology used: K-Mean Clustering   
Database: 	   SQL
Summary:             Alarms generated by various devices are usually assign
     with the code and few descriptions. With the help of 
     K-Mean Clustering the alarm is passed to correct team 
    for investigation.

· Vodafone Shared Services 
VoIP Specialist (May 2015 to May 2016)
Involve in designing the UCCE call flow, configuring the gateways and implementing the new changes or new VoIP setups as per the customer requirement.
