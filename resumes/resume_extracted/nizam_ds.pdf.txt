APR 2018 - PRESENTTo predict the traffic on a new mode of transport
DXC Technologies
The client is considering making an investment in a new form of transportation - Deusche
Bahn Rail. Deusche Bahn uses Jet propulsion technology to run rails and move people at a
high speed! While Deusche Bahn has mastered the technology,  the investment would only
make sense, if they can get more than 1 Million monthly users with in next 18 months.  (Python,
Scikit-learn, Univariate time-series, ARIMA)

2016 - 2018To predict the category of different human activities
Wipro Technologies
In this project, Client wanted us  to predict human activity (1-Walking, 2-Walking upstairs, 3-
Walking downstairs, 4-Sitting, 5-Standing or 6-Laying) by using the smartphone’s sensors.
(Python, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN), Keras, Tensorflow )

2015 - 2016To predict if a loan will get approved or not
Wipro Technologies
Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail
provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status,
Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To
automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those
are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.
