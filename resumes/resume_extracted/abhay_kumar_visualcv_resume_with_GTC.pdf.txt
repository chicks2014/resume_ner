I am an applied computer vision data scientist who have had experience in a leading a bunch of
other data scientists. I have used my leadership and applied deep learning skills to successfully
execute various computer vision projects. Highly skilled in applied deep learning - Computer
Vision. Good understanding of various computer vision techniques like classification, bounding
box classification and regression(object detection),pixel wise prediction(segmentation),
sequence classification with LSTMs (video classification). Good Interpreter of business
requirements into technical terms and vice versa. Excellent in use case identification from
business requirements. 

Achievements include execution of various computer vision projects like building character
identification,fashion style guide recommender, Fashion attribute predictor, activity detection,
image search engine.

My work got accepted in AI & Deep Learning Conference | GTC 2018 | NVIDIA.
I am looking for a role where i can leverage my skills and experience for the betterment of the
Organisation and further improvement to my own learning.

I am a regular AI/ML blogger. I am a firm believer in Andre NG's view of democratising AI. I pass
on my knowledge to the community through various blogs.

Men Style Guide creation 
Cogknit Semantics
Recommend best matching attire for men given a particular attire. The recommended attire is
created on the fly with an inspiration from an automated style guide. The automated style
guide  brings the trend factor by following feeds of the fashion celebrities and accordingly
create the combination for recommendation.

Built with pandas, numpy, tensorflow, keras

Extract attributes  like scene count,scene boundaries of each scene, scene identification ,
Character identification , Character's facial features identification , activity detection ,
objectionable activity flagging , speaker identification and close caption generation across all
scenes. The extracted attributes will be exposed micro service for further business
monetisation.

Built with tensorflow, Kaldi, Keras,OpenCV  

Face and Voice based authenticated wallet
Cogknit Semantics
An authentication system which can be provide multi modal authentication with signals from
face and voice . The authentication can be attached against any payment system . In our case
we attached it against a payment system which was running over blockchain.

Automated transcript generation from advertisement video for
e-retail
Cogknit Semantics
The project aims in solving a business case the e-retailers website should accessible to a
visually impaired person. Aim is to create a transcripts having visual and audio
information about the given video. This transcript would contain complete information
including all actions , emotions , clothing attributes and spoken sentences. This transcript
would be used by the video owners in explaining their products to visually impaired person.

Built with tensorflow, Kaldi, Keras,OpenCV  

Scene Retrieval using Tensorflow and Opencv
Cogknit Semantics
This system allows you to retrieve and play a video from the scene that you desire.

Built using openCV as means of IO,Inception-v3 CNN encoder from tensorflow to
extract features of the video.

Image search using tensorflow
Cogknit Semantics
This system has been trained to recognise categories of the query image and then to retrieve
the most closest match under the identified category as a search result.

Built with tensorflow  CNN classifier, encoder and vectorised search system.

Automated image curation system using tensorflow
Cogknit Semantics
This system helps in accelerating the cleaning process of the training data of image classifiers.
It brings out all the junks from the training data and provides a system to delete/move from the
categories.

Built with tensorflow CNN feature extractors and vectorised information retrieval
technique.

Auto correction of e-Commerce catalogue using caffe
Cogknit Semantics
This system tries to find the mis-placed item under a category in an e-commerce
catalogue.Once it finds the misplaced item it reports it to the admin and then suggest the
correct category under which the product should actually be placed.

Built with caffe CNN classifier. 

Automated Attendance system
Cogknit Semantics
This marks an employee presence in office by detecting his/her face at the entry of the office.

2015 - 2016

Built with tensorflow CNN classifier and openCV.

Auto tagging of visual contents for indexing using tensorflow
Cogknit Semantics
This system automatically generates a textual description of an image.

This also marks the image with multiple tags as per the objects detected in the image.

Captioning system built with CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder system. Meta tag generation
is built using Faster-RCNN network.

Recommendation System for smart learning using numpy
Cogknit Semantics
Recommends learning contents to an user based on his and his peer activities.The learning
process of like minded learners is collaborated to suggest  new and useful contents to an user.

Collaborative filtering of user and item attributes has been used .
