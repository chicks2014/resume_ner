WORK EXPERIENCE

DECISION SCIENTIST

MU SIGMA -  Bengaluru, Karnataka -

2015 to Present

Projects
TEXT ANALYTICS | MUFUSION - FOR MU SIGMA
‣ Developed a text analysis engine used by fortune 500 clients. The text analysis engine
developed in Python supporting
English and Japanese text leverages Sentiment analysis, Theme identification, Categorisation,
Named Entity Recognition,
Clustering and Word co-occurrence modules to generate insights for decision making.

DATA QUALITY AND VALUE ASSESSMENT - FOR A US BASED ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY
‣ Designed and developed a comprehensive and versatile Data quality and Value assessment
module for a US based asset
management company. The module developed on Jupyter notebook with a Python kernel brought
down the time of data
quality assessment of more than 500 million rows of data from 60hours to 50mins, was
compatible with different types of datasets (transaction, health-care, geolocation etc.) and
generated 2 reports. It allowed flexibility to the user to tailor the
conditions and checks according to the business and assess the quality of data.

THE ENERGY INSIGHTS APP - FOR A TOP ENERGY FIRM
‣ Developed a one stop application hosted on Predix platform for a fortune 100 energy firm which
helps the business
development managers throughout customer engagement journey by leveraging the data
available from multiple sources to have richer conversations with customers and help them in
taking better decisions to achieve their energy efficiency goals
(by generating realistic project roadmap using mixed integer optimisation and linear
programming) . Handled the entire
backend of the application using python.

FINDING DONORS - FOR UDACITY ML BASIC NANO-DEGREE
‣ In this project I applied and evaluated supervised learning techniques like Gaussian Naive
Bayes, SVM and Random Forest on data collected for the U.S. census to help CharityML (a fictitious
charity organisation) identify people most likely to donate to
their cause. Afterwards, I optimised the Random Forest model and presented it as my solution
to CharityML. (GitHub)

CUSTOMER SEGMENTS - FOR UDACITY ML BASIC NANO-DEGREE
‣ In this project, I analysed a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending
amounts of diverse product
categories for internal structure using PCA and Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm
to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor
interacts with to provide insight into how to best structure their
delivery service to meet the needs of each customer. (GitHub)
